TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock base_i/Audio_controller/clk_wiz_audio/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock base_i/Audio_controller/clk_wiz_audio/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin base_i/Audio_controller/clk_wiz_audio/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

The latch base_i/HDMI_FFT_LR/Packet_framer_R/inst/data_buffer_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin base_i/HDMI_FFT_LR/Packet_framer_R/inst/data_buffer_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#146 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch base_i/HDMI_FFT_LR/Packet_framer_R/inst/data_buffer_reg[9] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin base_i/HDMI_FFT_LR/Packet_framer_R/inst/data_buffer_reg[9]/G is not reached by a timing clock

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '10' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
